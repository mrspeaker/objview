# ObjViewer

Idea is just to drop 3d obj files or folders and display in a scene.

Currently needs a matching .obj and .mtl

# build

* npm install
* npm start

Browse on http://localhost:9966
Drop a .mtl and .obj file


# TODO

* Camera control
* Place randomly
* Click/move obj
* Save
* Drop folder
* Show obj without material
